# Cost Estimator Project Plan

## Project Information
This will be a cost estimating app that will be used by the client to go and meet clients and use previous projects as a point of reference to help predict the cost of other projects that they will be working on.  They will be able to make an estimate, view all of the estimates, and use a map to look at the jobs that are nearby on the map.
